1. <b>Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve build and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.</b>

   In this step, you will provide a comprehensive explanation of the foundational principles and advantages of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). You will emphasize how CI/CD enables the automation of the build and deployment processes for software products hosted in cloud environments. This automation enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and enables faster delivery of new features and updates to end-users.

2. <b>Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.</b>

   During this stage, you will leverage various Deployment Strategies to devise and construct robust CI/CD pipelines that facilitate Continuous Delivery. You will explore different techniques and best practices for managing code deployments, such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, or rolling updates. By implementing these strategies, you ensure the smooth and reliable delivery of software changes to the production environment, reducing downtime and minimizing the impact on users.

3. <b>Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.</b>

   In this step, you will employ a configuration management tool to streamline and automate the deployment process to cloud-based servers. This tool will enable you to define and manage the desired state of your infrastructure, including servers, networking, and software configurations, in a centralized manner. By leveraging this approach, you can easily replicate and scale your deployments, ensure consistency across different environments, and simplify the management and maintenance of your cloud-based infrastructure.

4. <b>Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.</b>

   During this stage, you will establish a mechanism for identifying and diagnosing critical server errors by implementing a centralized and structured logging system. This system will capture and organize log data generated by various components of your application or infrastructure. By analyzing these logs, you can quickly identify and address any issues or errors that may occur, ensuring the stability and reliability of your cloud-based software products.
